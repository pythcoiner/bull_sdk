# bull_sdk

Unified flutter_rust_bridge bindings for Bitcoin and Liquid wallet operations.

## Why

Over the past years, we contributed to the open source community by creating flutter_rust_bridge bindings for several Bitcoin/Liquid libraries:

- [ark-wallet-dart](https://github.com/SatoshiPortal/ark-wallet-dart) — Ark protocol
- [bbqr-dart](https://github.com/SatoshiPortal/bbqr-dart) — Animated QR encoding
- [boltz-dart](https://github.com/SatoshiPortal/boltz-dart) — Boltz atomic swaps
- [lwk-dart](https://github.com/SatoshiPortal/lwk-dart) — Liquid Wallet Kit

Each of these packages works standalone and is used by other projects in the community.

However, our wallet app [Bull Bitcoin](https://github.com/SatoshiPortal/BULL) depends on all of them. This creates two problems:

1. **Build time** — Each package compiles its own native library (`.so`/`.dylib`). Building them all individually is slow, especially for Android where each targets 3 architectures.
2. **Binary size** — Shared Rust dependencies (bitcoin, secp256k1, tokio, openssl, etc.) are duplicated across each native library.

## Approach

`bull_sdk` is a single flutter_rust_bridge package that generates unified Dart bindings by scanning the Rust API of each sub-crate as external dependencies:

```yaml
# flutter_rust_bridge.yaml
rust_input: crate::api, ark_wallet::ark, bbqr, dart_bbqr::api, boltz::api, lwk::api
```

This produces **one native library** containing all the Rust code, with **one FRB dispatcher** handling all FFI calls.

### Key constraints

- **Standalone packages are preserved** — Each sub-crate remains a fully functional standalone flutter_rust_bridge package. The community can keep using `boltz-dart` or `lwk-dart` independently.
- **Sub-crate `frb_generated` is cfg-gated** — When used as a dependency of `bull_sdk`, each sub-crate's `frb_generated.rs` is disabled via `#[cfg(not(feature = "bull_sdk"))]` to avoid duplicate trait implementations. `bull_sdk` provides its own unified `frb_generated.rs`.
- **Mirror types for data-variant enums** — Rust enums with data (like `TxFee`, `ArkTransaction`) become opaque when scanned as external crate types. We use `#[frb(mirror)]` to generate proper sealed Dart classes.
- **Post-processing** — After FRB codegen, `fix_frb_generated.sh` patches the generated Rust code to wrap error types in `FrbWrapper` and convert mirrored types via `.into()`.

```

The submodules are not a build input: cargo resolves each crate from the `rev`
pinned in `packages/bull_sdk/rust/Cargo.toml`, which is the source of truth, and
no Dart path dependency points into `packages/`. Keep a submodule pointer equal
to its cargo `rev` so the checked-out source matches what actually builds.

## Regenerating bindings

```bash
cd packages/bull_sdk
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate
bash fix_frb_generated.sh
cargo check -p rust_lib_bull_sdk
```

Always run `fix_frb_generated.sh` after codegen — it patches error type wrapping and mirror type conversions that FRB cannot handle automatically for external crate types.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:bull_sdk/bull_sdk.dart';
import 'package:bull_sdk/boltz.dart' as boltz;
import 'package:bull_sdk/lwk.dart' as lwk;
import 'package:bull_sdk/bbqr.dart' as bbqr;
import 'package:bull_sdk/ark.dart' as ark;

await BullSdk.init();
```
