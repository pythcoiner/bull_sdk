//! This is the information the previous C-ABI wrapper discarded: it reduced
//! the whole of [`arti_client::status::BootstrapStatus`] to a single `bool`
//! captured once at startup. arti's own documentation warns that the status is
//! **not monotonic** — a client can become *less* bootstrapped when
//! connectivity drops or its directory expires — so a one-shot boolean is
//! wrong by construction, and the failure only surfaces later at the
//! application layer.
